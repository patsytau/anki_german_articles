# Deutsche Artikel - German Articles

This is a simple deck to help learn german articles. It consists of single-sided cards: the front provides the article type, gender, and case, the back provides the article itself.

The article type is either the definite article (*bestimmter Artikel*) or all three of the indefinite, negative, and possessive articles (*unbestimmte / negative / possessive Artikeln*). Note that other possessive articles (ihr, dein, unser, etc.) take the same endings, but are not detailed here for the sake of brevity.

There are some entries where the article is followed by, say, *(...-s)*. This indicates that the following noun should have an *s* or *es* (as appropriate) appended to it.
