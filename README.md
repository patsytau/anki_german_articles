# Deutsche Artikel - German Articles

This is a simple deck to help learn german articles. It consists of single-sided cards: the front provides the article type, gender, and case, the back provides the article itself.

The article type is either the definite article (*bestimmter Artikel*) or the indefinite, negative, and possessive articles (*unbestimmte / negative / possessive Artikel*). Note that other possessive articles (ihr, dein, unser, etc.) behave in exactly the same way, but for the sake of brevity, are not listed in the cards.

There are some entries where the article is followed by, say, *(...-s)*. This indicates that the following noun should have an *s* or *es* (as appropriate) appended to it.
